			<h2>Commercial Web Delivery</h2>
			<p>We explored two different methods for web-based delivery of GIS 
			maps through an ESRI environment in this course. The first was 
			through ArcGIS Server, and built upon the work we had done 
			previously in SQL and database design. The second method was through 
			ArcGIS.com, which although allowed for less customization and fewer 
			features, was a simpler system to use and allowed for sharing of 
			static maps or maps using only external services without the need 
			for maintaining your own server system. Both systems over 
			considerable advantages over traditional GIS dissemination systems.&nbsp; 
			Unlike desktop GIS software, they are much easier to use, and even 
			someone with no prior GIS background would likely have a relatively 
			easy time using them. And unlike static maps, whether electronic or 
			paper-based, they allow for considerably more interaction from the 
			end user.</p>
			<p><strong>ArcGIS Server</strong></p>
			<p>We built upon the work we had done previously in the George 
			Washington Birthplace National Monument to allow users to 
			investigate our data in a number of ways, view them in the context 
			of additional data provided from other sources, and even run their 
			own analysis. While the web applications created for this course 
			will likely not exist past the end of the semester, images of these 
			functional applications are provided below with a basic description 
			of their functionality.</p>
			<p><strong>Query &amp; Display Application</strong></p>
			<p>The application below is the first, and simplest, of those 
			created for this course. It allows the used to identify fish samples 
			occurring at various sampling locations found within our site, as 
			well as various pieces of information which may be of relevance to 
			the researcher. By using a custom-created view, information from 
			multiple tables is combined, and only the pieces which are needed 
			are show. You can also a background image, provided through Bing, 
			which is an external service integrated into this project. In 
			additional to simple background imagery, there are a number of 
			external services from various providers available on the internet 
			which can easily be incorporated into a project like this to provide 
			additional information or context.</p>

			<p class="style3"><strong>Geoprocessing Services</strong></p>
			<p class="style3">Below is the second ArcGIS Server application 
			created. In this example, a simple geoprocessing service was created 
			to allow the user to buffer the sampling locations by a set 
			distance, and then clipped this buffer to the extent of the 
			waterbodies. This might be useful, for example, to visually analyze 
			how much water area surrounded each sampling site. Gamefish could 
			also be search for by weight, allowing greater querying capabilities 
			to the end user. Finally, a print function was included to allow 
			users to print copies of their results. All dialog boxes created for 
			this process are illustrated below.</p>

			<p class="style3">Geoprocessing in the ArcGIS Server environment is 
			actually quite similar to in the Desktop environment, and we 
			actually used Model Builder within ArcGIS Desktop to build our model 
			for analyis. The model for this application is show below.</p>

			<p class="style3"><strong>Interactive Geoprocessing Services</strong></p>
			<p class="style3">The final project we built in the section of the 
			course provided a more robust and interactive geoprocessing tool to 
			the end user. This application was developed to allow the user to 
			site a potential visitors&#39; center at the George Washington 
			Birthplace National Monument, while taking into account culturally 
			significant features which may be disturbed within a given buffer 
			from the site. Users can draw the potential location, and define the 
			buffer distance, allowing a much more interactive experience than 
			our previous application.</p>

			(click to enlarge)</p>
			<p class="style3">Our geoprocessing model for this application was 
			considerably more complex than the previous application, but still 
			fairly easy to follow.</p>

			<img alt="" class="style2" height="216" src="images/model.png" width="533" /></a><br />
			(click to enlarge)</p>
			<p class="style3"><strong>ArcGIS.com</strong></p>
			<p class="style3">Also in this section of the course, we explored 
			using ArcGIS.com for map sharing.&nbsp; For this assignment, I 
			created an online map using ArcGIS Online to display information 
			relevant to George Washington Birthplace National Monument. Included 
			on the map are the fish inventories and park boundaries served from 
			virginislands.cnr.ncsu.edu and created in a prior assignment. Fish 
			inventories are clickable and the user can cycle through all fish 
			located at each point on the map. Also included is a wetlands 
			inventory I found through ArcGIS Online, which is similar to the 
			wetlands layer I had included in a previous assignment as well. I 
			restricted this service to the types appropriate to the location to 
			keep the information relevant and the legend concise. I also enabled 
			popups for this layer, as it allowed each wetland area to be clicked 
			on to determine area and wetland type.</p>
			<p class="style3">In addition to these services, I also enabled a 
			few other features. A bookmark was created at the extent of the park 
			boundaries so that users can quickly return to this location if they 
			zoom or pan to other parts of the map. Additionally, an editable 
			layer was included. This layer, entitled “Places to Photograph,” 
			highlights some key locations within the park. As others like myself 
			may be working on this project without ever having visited the site, 
			this enables users to identify locations that they may wish to 
			photograph when they are able to visit – either to give context to 
			maps or reports produced, or simply for pleasure. I included photos 
			linked from the National Park Service website as examples.</p>
			<p class="style3">I also experimented with a few other services but 
			decided not to include them. First, I tried to see if there was a 
			way to include a public photo feed in KML format, either from Flickr 
			or Panoramio or a similar service, which I thought might be 
			interesting to potential visitors. However, I could not get either 
			service to generate a feed that was localized to the specific area I 
			was targeting. I also tried to get radar reflectivity, and was 
			successful with this, but found that at the moment it did not 
			produce a very interesting map as there were no significant weather 
			events taking place in the eastern United States during the 
			timeframe in which the map was being created. I may explore continue 
			to explore using these services for a different map, though.<br />
			<br />
			The map can be accessed

			online currently</a>, though the fish inventories service will 
			likely become unavailable following the conclusion of this course.</p>
			<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
			<p>When it comes to professional quality GIS software, it is clear 
			that ESRI is the leader of the pack, and I was glad to have this 
			opportunity to work with tools which allow me the opportunity to 
			extend some of the analysis work I had done previously on desktop 
			software to a wider audience through these delivery mechanisms. I 
			think that some of the tools available on ArcGIS.com could be 
			important for introducing a wider audience to GIS and help them 
			utilize it in a way that is meaningful to their own work. But the 
			most exciting part for me was using ArcGIS Server to implement 
			interactive geoprocessing services. So many times, as someone active 
			in local government I have wished for the ability to empower 
			individual citizens to test their hypotheses without having to place 
			the burden on town staff to manuallly run each simulationn.&nbsp; 
			ArcGIS Server gives that power. For example, Orange County where I 
			live has been struggling with siting a new landfill for decades now, 
			with our current landfill set to be closed in just over a year. 
			Often citizens, elected officials, and advocacy groups come up with 
			a set of criteria (distance from schools, type of road it would sit 
			on, distance from population centers, conflicts with environmental 
			resources) that they want to prioritize, but with no way to see 
			which areas might meet their stated desires. A well done application 
			in ArcGIS Server could allow each of these groups to test their 
			ideas quickly and easily without prior GIS experience.<br />

			<h2>Geodatabase Design</h2>
			<p>While the tabular databases we worked with at the beginning of 
			the course can be incorporated into geospatial analysis in a variety 
			of methods, databases can be used to store geometries of spatial 
			objects as well. A spatially enable database, also called a 
			geodatabase, usually also contains tabular elements as well. But by 
			combining all of the data associated with a project in a single 
			location, a number of advantages can be realized. Data organization 
			is easier, data access may be faster, and data can be more readily 
			shared between applications and across systems. Choosing the 
			appropriate type of geodatabase is critical to good data management.</p>
			<p><strong>ESRI Training</strong></p>
			<p>To better understand the issues related to this unit, I completed 
			three online courses through ESRI. They were
			<a href="pdf/jebaker3-geodb.pdf">Getting Started with the Geodatabase</a>,
			<a href="pdf/jebaker3-topology.pdf">Getting Started with Geodatabase Topology</a>, 
			and <a href="pdf/jebaker3-domains.pdf">Working with Geodatabase Domains and 
			Subtypes</a>. Please click the hyperlinks to view copies of my 
			completion certificates. These courses helped explain the basics of 
			each topic and prepared us for the course assignments.</p>
			<p><strong>Feature Datasets and Feature Classes</strong></p>
			<p>Feature datasets and feature classes are the basic geometery 
			management concepts for storing and organizing data inside of a 
			geodatabase. A feature class is the database equivalent of a 
			shapefile used within a traditional file system. While there may be 
			multiple tables and table parts which describe the geometry and 
			properties within the database itself, to the end user working in an 
			ESRI environment only a single element representing the geometry is 
			shown. A feature dataset is roughly the equivalent of a file 
			system&#39;s folder, and enable the user to better organize his or her 
			geometries. Below is an example illustrating the organization of a 
			database we created containing various geometries of the George 
			Washington Birthplace National Monument.</p>
			<p class="style1">
			<img alt="" height="345" src="images/geodb.png" width="247" /></p>
			<p><strong>Topological Concepts</strong></p>
			<p>Database topology describes the spatial relationships between 
			feature classes in a geodatabase, allowing the user to define 
			expected relationships between objects in order to correct errors 
			and better identify exceptions. For the example database above, we 
			were asked to define a number of topological relationships. Some of 
			the relationships I defined are highlighted below.</p>
			<p>I created at least one topology rule for each feature dataset.&nbsp; 
			For the boundary topology, I applied the simple rule that it must 
			not overlap.&nbsp; Even though the park boundaries may contain multiple 
			parts, if the parts were to overlap there would clearly be an error 
			present.</p>
			<p>Within the structures feature dataset, I created two rules.&nbsp; One, 
			that fences must not overlap (because it is physically very unlikely 
			that one fence would be built on top of another), and two, that 
			buildings must not overlap with roads (because this is also 
			physically unlikely).&nbsp; There was one error detected upon validation 
			of a fence feature overlapping itself.&nbsp; There were also two errors 
			detected of a building errantly falling upon a road; though the 
			overlap was of less than a foot, probably either the road or the 
			building boundary should be corrected to reflect the correct 
			location of each.</p>
			<p>Within vegetation, I created a rule that natural vegetation must 
			not overlap; if there were an overlap, it would probably be due to a 
			drawing error, even though some overlap in coverage could make 
			logical sense.&nbsp; And within water, I created a rule that stream must 
			be single part; a two- or more part stream could indicate that an 
			unintentional gap was left in what logically should be a continuous 
			flow of water.</p>
			<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list of possible topological 
			relationships and rules which might be created for George Washington 
			Birthplace National Monument.&nbsp; Someone more familiar with the data 
			and the data needs of the park would be able to define many more 
			additional relationships that would benefit them, as well as 
			determining which would be most useful to employ. </p>
			<p><strong>Single-User Geodatabases</strong></p>
			<p>Single user databases are generally best used for organizing data 
			for one person working on a desktop system without sharing.&nbsp; 
			While a single user database can be shared with others, it does not 
			allow for concurrent editing. But unlike a multi-user database, it 
			is comparatively simple to set up and does not require a server 
			environment to use. The two types of single user geodatabases in an 
			ESRI environment are file geodatabases and personal geodatabases. 
			The former is a proprietary format, but allows for larger databases 
			to be constructed and seems to have better support from ESRI. The 
			latter is essentially a spatially-enabled Microsoft Access database, 
			which may be simpler to use but it seems that ESRI may be moving 
			away from supporting this type of database. It is important to be 
			familiar with them, though, as there may be existing databases in 
			this format that a GIS practitioner may encounter and need to work 
			with.</p>
			<p><strong>Multi-User Geodatabases</strong></p>
			<p>Multi-user geodatabases are considerably more complex, as they 
			integrate components across multiple systems (though occasionally 
			you may run all components locally). However, they allow for 
			considerably more flexibility. They enable concurrent editing by 
			multiple users, and may serve as the backend for a web-based GIS 
			delivery system as we explored later in the course. Below is the 
			diagram describing the system configuration we used in this course. 
			This diagram shows the isolation between the client users (who may 
			be using desktop or web based software) and the database backend, 
			which is typically an SQL server (which may or may not handle its 
			own storage technology). Middleware called ArcSDE enables 
			communication between the SQL server and the ArcGIS Server, which 
			serves out web-based applications to users, as well as ArcIMS to 
			share the geodata as a service. In our case, our SQL server, ArcSDE, 
			and ArcGIS Server were hosted on the same machine, but this is not 
			always the case.</p>

			<p class="style3">The ESRI software simplifies the view of the data 
			somewhat, removing some transparency but making access to the 
			correct data store much easier to the user. Below is an image of all 
			of the tables related to our example database, as show in PgAdmin 
			III, with the source of each table demarcated.</p>
			<p class="style1">
			<img alt="" height="688" src="images/pgAdminIII.png" width="600" /></p>
			<p class="style3">Below is the same database as shown in ArcGIS 
			Desktop.&nbsp; You can see that it is considerably simplified, as 
			the geometries are shown in a logical format rather than just as the 
			tables which contain them.</p>

			<p class="style3">&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
			<p>This section of the course really reformed my personal practice 
			in maintaining geospatial data. While certainly the work with 
			multiuser databases will be useful in larger enterprise situations, 
			even just rethinking the way I manage data on my personal machine 
			has been helpful.&nbsp; I have worked on a number of projects using 
			a similar dataset, and up until now had largely kept a set of 
			disorganized shapefiles strewn around my hard drive. I knew how to 
			import them into a geodatabase, but never took the time until taking 
			this course because I didn&#39;t see the advantage.&nbsp; But now that I 
			have done so, portability has become much easier, organization has 
			improved by using feature datasets, and I&#39;ve even begun to think 
			about ways that I can use topological relationships for my work. 
			Since much of the time I am working with data from multiple 
			agencies, topological relationships could conceivably help me 
			identify they areas where the data does not match up as expected - 
			for example, where transit route lines don&#39;t follow street 
			centerlines as they should logically, and begin to correct any 
			problems.</p>

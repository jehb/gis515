			<h2>Database Design</h2>
			<p>We began our coursework with an introductory look at database 
			design, and developed an example project involving a fish sampling 
			database through several stages of the design process.&nbsp; We 
			first created an entity-relationship (ER) diagram to conceptually 
			describe our goal, followed by a unified modeling language (UML) 
			diagram. To assist in the design of these diagrams, we used an open 
			source computer aided software engineering (CASE) tool called
			<a href="http://dia-installer.de/">Dia</a>. A script was then used 
			to generate data definition language (DDL) code from our diagram for 
			import into an actual database. Some illustration of these steps is 
			shown below.<br />
			</p>
			<p><strong>Key Terminology</strong></p>
			<p class="style3"><strong><em>Primary Key:</em> </strong>A primary 
			key is the first field which contains a unique entry in each row of 
			a table through which that record can be referenced; it allows for 
			establishing relationships between data stored in different tables 
			in a database.<br />
			<strong><em>Foreign Key:</em></strong> A foreign key is a field 
			which serves in a table as a reference to the primary key in a 
			different table, allowing an entry to link to a unique row in the 
			second table.<strong><br />
			<em>Referential Integrity:</em></strong> Referential integrity is 
			the principle that enforces the connection between primary and 
			foreign keys by requiring that a primary key exist in one table 
			corresponding to the foreign key that references it in another 
			table. Referential integrity ensures that no foreign keys exist 
			which reference a non-existent primary key.<br />
			<strong><em>Database Relationship:</em></strong> A database 
			relationships link tables together in a meaningful way. A 
			relationship may be one-to one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, 
			depending on whether or not a field may show up multiple times in 
			either the referring or the referenced table.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>ER Diagram</strong></p>
			<p>The entity-relationship diagram, shown below, illustrates in 
			conceptual terms the relationships between the different elements of 
			our database model.&nbsp; In this model, we see the various 
			components of each table illustrated as ovals connected to 
			rectangles, and relationships between tables indicated as connected 
			diamonds. Items with a double oval are keys, which means that they 
			are values that we can either use singularly (simple keys) or in 
			combination (composite keys) to refer to a unique value within the 
			table and its associated properties. Simple keys are appropriate 
			when every key corresponds to a unique value - when two or more keys 
			are necessary to define a unique value, a composite key is 
			necessary. We are also able to define the direction of the 
			relationship, and the type, either one-to-one or one-to-many.&nbsp; 
			Together these elements are referred to as the cardinality of the 
			relationship.</p>

			<p class="style3"><strong>UML Diagram</strong></p>
			<p class="style3">From our ER diagram, we then proceeded to create a 
			UML diagram of the same conceptual database. As you can see in the 
			image below, the look of the image has changes somewhat, but we 
			still preserve the relationships and their cardinality, and the keys 
			are still defined. What has changed is that we have now given the 
			elements of our design computer-friendly names that will be used in 
			the actual code, and we have also defined the data types that we 
			will use to represent each item in the appropriate table. Deciding 
			the appropriate data type (strings, numbers, etc.) requires making 
			decisions about not only how the data is best represented, but what 
			actions you may wish to take on a piece of data within your program 
			code. For example, numbers can be added and subtracted, but the same 
			information represented as a string might be useful if we were 
			trying to parse or concatenate it within a sentence.</p>

			<p class="style3"><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL)</strong></p>
			<p class="style3">Finally, we used a Perl-based script (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Parse-Dia-SQL/">available 
			here</a>) to convert from our UML diagram created in Dia to data 
			definition language, which would allow us to set up our actual SQL 
			database and then populate it with data. In this course, we used 
			PostgreSQL for our database engine, but the same concepts apply to 
			other database tools.&nbsp; The code generated from the above UML 
			diagram is show below. Some minor modifications had to be made in 
			order for the code to be valid for execution.</p>

			<p class="style3">We connected to our remotely-hosted database via a 
			tool called <a href="http://www.pgadmin.org/docs/1.8/index.html">
			PgAdmin III</a> which enabled us to execute the code. The next step 
			was to populate the tables. An example populated table can be seen 
			on the <a href="sql.html">SQL page</a> on this site.</p>
			<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
			<p>While in a production environment I may not go through every step 
			of the Entity-Relationship design process in such rigid detail as we 
			did for this class, I think it is incredibly important to understand 
			the meaning of relationships underlying database design. Unified 
			Modeling Language and related CASE tools, however, I think are an 
			incredibly useful tool for database design. Being able to visualize 
			components in a way that makes components of a database design clear 
			makes simple projects easier and larger projects possible. And 
			without a clear visual understanding of how the database is 
			designed, maintenance and modifcation in the future become 
			significantly more difficult. Diagrams from CASE tools also make it 
			much easier to communicate your system design with others who you 
			may be collaborating with on a givne project. And while it was 
			beyond the scope of this course, I look forward to extending my 
			personal understanding of UML to be able to utilize it as a code 
			generation tool for other languages which I may use in a GIS career, 
			such as Java and Python. </p>

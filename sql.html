			<h2>Structured Query Language (SQL)</h2>
			<p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a computer programming 
			language designed specifically for working with databases. While it 
			varies somewhat between implementations, it is universal enough that 
			it can be used in a variety of environments and systems. We learned 
			the basics of SQL syntax for populating database tables and 
			performing queries on the information they hold, which could then be 
			turned into permanent views for use in applications.</p>
			<p class="style3"><strong>Populating the Database</strong></p>
			<p class="style3">After setting up the database template, the next 
			step was to populate it with data. In our case, the data had been 
			provided as file of comma delimited values, so the population was 
			fairly simple. We simply needed to run a line of SQL for each table 
			in the database, which took the form: <span class="style5"><strong>
			COPY tbl_name FROM &#39;C:/location/data.txt&#39; Delimiters &#39;,&#39; CSV;</strong></span></p>
			<p class="style3">Order was important - tables needed to be 
			populated according to their referential integrity. In other words, 
			if a table relationship depended on information in another table, 
			the other table needed to be populated first.&nbsp; Once this was 
			done, the information in each table could be viewed in PgAdmin III, 
			and could then be utilized in our applications. A sample table is 
			below.</p>
			<p class="style1">
			<img alt="" height="612" src="images/sampletable.png" width="580" /></p>
			<p><strong>SQL Syntax and Examples</strong></p>
			<p>The syntax of structured query language is fairly 
			straightforward. In its most basic form, to perform a query one 
			would ask SELECT which_field FROM which_table WHERE 
			what_things_are_true. The where clause may, for example, link two 
			tables through a common key by indicating table1.key = table2.key, 
			or it may filter data by returning data where item1 = true. Other 
			statements exist for further limiting the data returned, joining it 
			with other data, or changing the way the returned data is displayed. 
			Below are some examples, taken from our fish database example, as 
			well as the output they returned.</p>

			<p>Queries may also be used to build Views, which are essentially 
			more permanent queries stored within the database. Views are useful 
			to allow outside programs, such as in our case ArcGIS Server, to 
			access a particular subset of data the we have built to meet our 
			needs.&nbsp; By storing the view in the database instead of the 
			application, it allows a layer of separation between the code and 
			the underlying database, so that changes can be made to database 
			structure without affecting the program as long as the view is 
			updated appropriately, or the view itself may be changed as well.</p>
			<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
			<p>I had worked previously in SQL in a very minor way prior to 
			taking this class - typically just modifying queries which had been 
			written by others in order to attempt to produce the results I 
			needed. So in my case, learning the language in a more comprehensive 
			way should prove to be useful, both within the context of my work in 
			GIS, but also in other web development and database management 
			components of other projects I have been involved with. 
			Particularly, I have worked with a number of web content management 
			systems which utilize MySQL, and understanding how to form complex 
			queries will be helpful for these projects as well. SQL is clearly a 
			very powerful tool for turning raw data into useful information, and 
			the fact that it has remained the predominant database query 
			language for so many years I think is indicative of its enduring 
			use.</p>

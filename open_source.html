			<h2>Open Source GIS</h2>
			<p>In this section of the course, we took a turn away from the ESRI 
			ArcGIS environment and explored open source solutions for web based 
			GIS applications. Open source software may not always be as robust 
			or well supported as its closed source counterparts, but it clearly 
			is a better option for some situations given its cost (free!), the 
			availablility of source code, and the strong community that has 
			grown up around it. While some open source GIS projects are still 
			playing catch-up, many are now well developed and the gaps in 
			reliabillity and ease-of-use are quickly eroding.</p>
			<p><strong>OpenGeo Suite</strong></p>
			<p>For the projects in this section, we utilized the
			<a href="http://opengeo.org/products/suite/">OpenGeo Suite</a>, 
			which is a packaged and commercially supported full stack system 
			consisting of many different components. On the database side, it 
			uses PostgreSQL similar to what we had used in ArcGIS Server, except 
			with PostGIS to enable spatial data.&nbsp; There are a number of 
			web-based components to support the server-based data.&nbsp; 
			GeoServer allows for the management of the storage, sharing, 
			organization, and projection of spatial data within the system.&nbsp; 
			GeoWebCache, which we did not explore in this course, provides fast 
			caching services for tile-based map images. GeoEditor is a web-based 
			interactive GIS system not unlike ArcGIS for the desktop.&nbsp; 
			GeoExplorer is more oriented towards end users for exploring, rather 
			than editing, data. Finally, Styler is included as a tool for 
			definiting the presentation of the data.</p>
			<p>Most of the work we did revolved around data in New York City, 
			including streets, census tracts, boroughs, and subway locations, 
			which we had to load into the GeoServer system and project properly.&nbsp; 
			Below is a view of this data as displayed in GeoExplorer</p>
			<p class="style1">&nbsp;<img alt="" height="456" src="images/nyc.png" width="676" /></p>
			<p><strong>Spatial SQL</strong></p>
			<p>Just as we had worked with structured query language to help us 
			answer questions about tabular data, in this unit we explored the 
			ways that SQL can be used to answer questions about spatial data as 
			well.&nbsp; The functions available to a spatial SQL system are 
			somewhat less standardized than the basic tabular SQL query 
			components we had worked with previously, but the
			<a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/documentation/manual-1.5SVN/index.html">
			PostGIS reference</a> provided the information necessary to access 
			the proper functions in this system. Provided below are some sample 
			queries and their results, as executed in PgAdmin III.</p>
			<p>Which subway station has the maximum number of people living 
			within 300 meters? How many people live there?</p>
			<p><span class="style3"><strong>SELECT s.name, Sum(c.popn_total) As 
			sum_pop FROM nyc_census_blocks as c join nyc_subway_stations as s on

			sum_pop DESC;</strong></span></p>

			BY popn_per_sqkm DESC;</strong></span></p>

			<p><br />
			What are all the streets with a B-train stop within 50 meters?</p>
			<p><span class="style3"><strong>SELECT DISTINCT st.name FROM 
			nyc_subway_stations AS s JOIN nyc_streets AS st ON 
			ST_DWithin(st.the_geom,s.the_geom,50) WHERE strpos(s.routes,&#39;B&#39;) &gt; 0 
			ORDER BY st.name;</strong></span></p>
			<p class="style1">

			<p><br />
			Which neighborhood has the hightest population density in 
			nyc_neighborhoods? What&#39;s the <br />

			(ST_Area(n.the_geom) / 1000000.0) AS popn_per_sqkm FROM

			ST_Intersects(c.the_geom, n.the_geom) GROUP BY n.name, n.the_geom 
			ORDER BY popn_per_sqkm DESC;</strong></span></p>

			</p>
			<p><strong>JavaScript &amp; Code Structures</strong></p>
			<p>Since all of the web-based GIS applications implement their 
			client-side scripting in JavaScript, we spent a good portion of the 
			course exploring JavaScript syntax and some of the necessary 
			libraries which are utilized by GeoExplorer.&nbsp; JavaScript is a 
			scripting language commonly used in the browser environment to 
			extend HTML, which has a similar syntax to Java. The libraries we 
			explored include <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs">
			ExtJS</a>, <a href="http://www.geoext.org/">GeoExt</a>, and
			<a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a>. By using these 
			tools and libraries in combination, very complex web application 
			customization is possible. JavaScript is embedded within HTML 
			directly or linked as an included file, which allows elements on a 
			webpage to function interactively.</p>
			<p><strong>OpenLayers</strong></p>
			<p>After using a few very basic examples to practice with the 
			JavaScript syntax, our first homework to integrate this technology 
			with a mapping application was to develop code to display some of 
			the New York City data being served from our local server 
			implentations through a simple web interface using OpenLayers. 
			Though fairly straightforward, this framework can be extended 
			greatly for additional display and interaction options. We also 
			repeated the process using the GeoExt library to create the map 
			frame.</p>
			<p class="style1">
			<img alt="" height="506" src="images/nyc2.png" width="628" /></p>
			<p><strong>GeoExplorer</strong></p>
			<p>The final piece of this portion of the course was to customize 
			the GeoExplorer application to include additional functionality. The 
			first task was to create a button which changed the bounds of the 
			map to zoom in on the boundaries of the state of North Carolina. The 
			second was to allow the user to interactively set the center of the 
			map by entering longitude and latitude coordinates.&nbsp; While not 
			terribly complex, these customizations are meant to demonstrate the 
			method for accessing map data and interacting with it on the client 
			side.&nbsp; Once this is done, the range of possible functions which 
			could be accomplished through client side mapping are enormous.</p>
			<p>This is what the map looks like before using either of the tools 
			I implemented.</p>
			<p class="style1">
			<img alt="" height="422" src="images/geo1.png" width="724" /></p>
			<p>This is the view after clicking on the button to zoom to the 
			North Carolina boundaries.</p>
			<p class="style1">
			<img alt="" height="423" src="images/geo2.png" width="724" /></p>
			<p>This is the view after entering approximate coordinates for San 
			José, Costa Rica, which is about (-84, 10).</p>
			<p class="style1">
			<img alt="" height="422" src="images/geo3.png" width="724" /></p>
			<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
			<p>I was particularly glad to have the opportunity to work with some 
			of the open source based tools, for a number of reasons.&nbsp; I 
			strongly believe that open source solutions are an important part of 
			the geospatial software ecosystem. As a long-time Linux user, I was 
			happy to be able to work with tools that would run natively on a 
			*nix system. Philosophically, I think it is important for there to 
			be low-cost options available, both for production environments and 
			to provide opportunities for the average user to &quot;look under the 
			hood&quot; if they so choose. By allowing users of software systems 
			complete access to the underlying source code behind GIS system, it 
			allows the provider to customize the end user&#39;s experience to the 
			maximum possible degree, only limited by factors like staff time. 
			But just as importantly, personally, becoming familiar with this 
			software may have immediate benefits.&nbsp; While I don&#39;t have the 
			resources available to acquire an ArcGIS Server license for every 
			pet project or nonprofit I have wanted to set up a web mapping 
			application for, a fully open sourced stack like OpenGeo Suite makes 
			it possible for me to bring GIS access to a larger audience without 
			software acquisition costs.</p>
